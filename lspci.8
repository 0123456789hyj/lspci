.IX lspci
.SH NAME
lspci \- list all PCI devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lspci
.RB [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lspci
is a utility for displaying information about all PCI busses in the system and
all devices connected to them. It requires Linux kernel 2.1.82 or newer and
supersedes the original /proc/pci interface found in earlier kernels.

If you are going to report bugs in PCI device drivers or in
.I lspci
itself, please include output of "lspci -vvx".

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v
Tells
.I lspci
to be verbose and display detailed information about all devices.
.TP
.B -vv
Tells
.I lspci
to be very verbose and display even more information (actually everything the
PCI device is able to tell). The exact meaning of these data is not explained
in this manual page, if you want to know more, consult
.B /usr/include/linux/pci.h
or the PCI specs.
.TP
.B -n
Show PCI vendor and device codes as numbers instead of looking them up in the
PCI ID database.
.TP
.B -x
Show hexadecimal dump of first 64 bytes of the PCI configuration space (the standard
header). Useful for debugging of drivers and
.I lspci
itself.
.TP
.B -xx
Show hexadecimal dump of whole PCI configuration space. Available only for root
as several PCI devices crash when you try to read undefined portions of the config
space (although this directly violates the PCI standard).
.TP
.B -b
Bus-centric view. Show all IRQ numbers and addresses as seen by the cards on the
PCI bus instead of as seen by the kernel.
.TP
.B -t
Show a tree-like diagram containing all busses, bridges, devices and connections
between them.
.TP
.B -B <bus>
Show only devices on specified bus.
.TP
.B -S <slot>
Show only devices in specified slot number.
.TP
.B -F <func>
Show only specified function number of all devices (you can mix it with
.B -B
and
.B -S
to select single device).
.TP
.B -V <vendor>
Show only devices having specified vendor ID.
.TP
.B -D <devid>
Show only devices having specified device ID.
.TP
.B -i <file>
Use
.B
<file>
as PCI ID database instead of /etc/pci.ids.
.TP
.B -p <dir>
Use
.B <dir>
as directory containing PCI bus information instead of /proc/bus/pci.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/pci.ids
A list of all known PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes and subclasses).
.TP
.B /proc/bus/pci
An interface to PCI bus configuration space provided by the kernel. Contains
per-bus subdirectories with per-card config space files and a
.I
devices
file containing a list of all PCI devices.
