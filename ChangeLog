	* Makefile: Recognize architecture by calling uname and pass it as ARCH_xxx
	to all the C sources. This should eliminate problems with 32-bit compilers
	on sparc64.

	* lspci.c (show_verbose): Recognize CardBus bridge header type.
	(show_htype2): Stub routine.
	(scan_config): Write sensible error message if the kernel denies reading of
	upper part of the PCI config space.
