All files in this package can be freely distributed and used according

(at your opinion) any newer version. This is the same distribution
policy as for the Linux kernel itself -- see /usr/src/linux/COPYING
for details.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BIG FAT WARNING: This is an ALPHA version. The documentation is out of date
		 and the same holds for spec files and even for this README.
		 And, of course, you should expect this release to contain BUGS.

WHY ALPHA?	 I've split the real PCI access primitives from the rest
		 of the code and created libpci, which supports not only
		 /proc/bus/pci, but also direct hardware access and reading
		 of configuration space dumps and it's intended to work
		 on all Linux versions and even on non-Linux systems, making
		 creation of portable programs communicating with PCI devices
		 possible.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Linux PCI Utilities contain various utilities for dealing with the PCI
bus in Linux:

	- lspci: displays detailed information about all PCI busses and devices
	  in the system, replacing the original /proc/pci interface.

	- setpci: allows to read from and write to PCI device configuration
	  registers. For example, you can adjust the latency timers with it.

   See manual pages for more details.

   You need kernel 2.1.82 or newer to use all functions of this package.
For older kernels, only direct hardware access is supported and you must
be root to use it.

   If you have any bug reports or suggestions, send them to the author.

   If you want, subscribe to linux-pci@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz (send
"subscribe linux-pci Your Full Name" to listproc@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz).
Release notes about new versions will be send to the list and problems with
the Linux PCI support will be probably discussed there, too.
